# Overview
 I provide a brief description on how to identify most actively traded stocks on a daily basis using the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Market Data Center, which lists the top 100 NYSE most active stocks (in terms of total volume). The link can be found [**here**](http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3021-activnyse-actives.html). I use the `rvest` R package to achieve so.
